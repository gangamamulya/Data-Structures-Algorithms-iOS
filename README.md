# Data Structures in Swift

This document categorizes and explains common **Linear** and **Nonlinear** data structures in Swift.

## Linear Data Structures

| **Data Structure** | **Description**                                                                                                                      | **Use Case**                                                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Array**          | An ordered collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory.                                                       | Efficient random access, iterating over collections.                    |
| **Linked List**    | A dynamic data structure where each element (node) contains a reference to the next element.                                           | Frequent insertions or deletions at arbitrary positions.                |
| **Stack**          | A Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end.                                      | Undo functionality, recursive algorithms, backtracking.                 |
| **Queue**          | A First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.                           | Task scheduling, breadth-first search, and real-time systems.           |
| **Tuple**          | A fixed-size collection of multiple values of potentially different types.                                                             | Returning multiple values from a function, grouping related values.     |
| **Optional**       | A type that represents the presence or absence of a value (`nil`).                                                                     | Handling nullable values, ensuring safety when working with variables.  |
| **Dictionary**     | A collection of key-value pairs where each key is unique.                                                                              | Efficient key-based lookups, representing mappings of unique keys to values. |
| **Set**            | An unordered collection of unique elements.                                                                                           | Ensuring uniqueness, fast membership checks.                            |
| **Range**          | Represents a sequence of values, usually numeric, between a start and end value.                                                      | Looping over a sequence, generating ranges in loops and conditions.     |

## Nonlinear Data Structures

| **Data Structure**         | **Description**                                                                                             | **Use Case**                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tree**                   | A hierarchical structure where each node can have zero or more child nodes.                                  | Representing hierarchical data such as file systems, XML, and organizational charts. |
| **Binary Search Tree (BST)**| A binary tree where the left child node is smaller than the parent, and the right child node is larger.       | Efficient searching, insertion, and deletion in a sorted dataset. |
| **Heap**                   | A complete binary tree where each parent node is greater (max-heap) or smaller (min-heap) than its children. | Implementing priority queues, fast retrieval of the smallest or largest element. |
| **Graph**                  | A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, representing pairwise relationships between elements.    | Representing networks such as social networks, transportation systems, or communication networks. |
